          <li>STYLE RULES</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Can set multiple effects separated by commas</li>
              <li>period preceding _____ (ie .card) designates CLASS selector</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>CLASS allows us to share a CSS rule to any element assigned to the CLASS</li>
                </ul>
              <li> A SELECTOR defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply; such as DIV, H1</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>DECLARATIONS contain two important components:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li> The CSS property we want to apply</li>
                      <li>The value of the property.</li> 
                    </ul>
                  <li>EX: The DECLARATION color: blue</li>  
                </ul>
              <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box that contains:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>MARGINS</li>
                  <li>BORDERS</li>

              <li>External Style Sheet: MUST LINK to HTML</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Link the file using a LINK element placed in the HTML's HEAD</li>
                  <li>Ex: LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="./assets/style.css" </li>
                </ul>
              <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page: use a special wild card symbol, or *</li>
            </ul>
          <li> STYLE OPTIONS</li>
          <ul>
            <li>COLOR uses semantic reference ie gray or by hex #</li>
            <li>WIDTH, use % or px</li>
            <li>MARGIN PROPERTY(how much space around the outside of an element)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Use px value to TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, & RIGHT</li>
                <li>AUTO can be used in place of px</li>
                <li>MARGIN 0: means no space around element</li>
              </ul>
            <li>PADDING: adds space around the content inside element</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Increase padding = enlargen element</li>
              </ul>
            <li>BORDER PROPERTY assigns a border with a WIDTH, HEIGHT, and COLOR</li>
            <li>BOX-SHADOW adds shadow effect arond element frame:</li>
               <ul>
                <li>uses X (+ right, - left) & Y (+ below, -above) to offset relative to element</li>
                <li>BLUR and SPREAD radius, and COLOR</li>
               </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS), a high-level dynamic programming language,  allows users to interact with websites</li> 
          <li>One of the most popular modern web technologies</li>
          <li>Can power  websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and more!</li>
          <li>A weakly typed language allowing implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types instead of throwing type errors.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form</li>
            </ul>
          <li>To do this JavaScript defines a handful of coercion rules.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The primitive coercion process is used where a primitive value is expected, but there's no strong preference for what the actual type should be.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
              </li>
              <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
              <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>JS RULES</li>
            <ul>
              <li>MUST link in the html sheet under footer before body closing tabs</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>the script.js file is linked within the BODY element.</li>
                  <li>ex: SCRIPT src="./assets/script.js" SCRIPT</li>
                </ul> 
              <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends</li>
              <li>Case sensitive</li>
              <li>All types except OBJECT define immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language aka PRIMITIVE VALUES</li>
              <li>All PRIMITIVE types, except NULL, can be tested by the TYPEOF operator.</li>
              <li>STRINGS are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it</li>
              <li>OBJECTS are the only mutable values</li> 
              <li>FUNCTIONS are also OBJECTS with the additional capability of being CALLABLE.</li>
              <li>When representing dates, the best choice is to use the built-in Date utility in JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>NULL vs UNDEFINED</li>
            <ul>
              <li>UNDEFINED is the absence of a value; NULL is the absence of an object</li>
              <li>NULL is a keyword; UNDEFINED is a normal identifier that is also a global property.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>NUMBER vs BIGINT</li>
            <ul>
              <li>NUMBER</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>A double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value.</li>
                  <li>Can store positive floating-point numbers between 2^-1074 (Number.MIN_VALUE) and 2^1024 (Number.MAX_VALUE)</li>
                  <li>And negative floating-point numbers between -2^-1074 and -2^1024</li>
                  <li>Can only safely store integers in the range -(253 - 1) (Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER) to 253 - 1 (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER). </li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Outside this range, JavaScript can no longer safely represent integers</li> 
                      <li>Unsafe intergers will instead be represented by a double-precision floating point approximation.</li>
                      <li>Check if a number is within the safety range using Number.isSafeInteger().</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
              <li>BIGINT</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A numeric primitive that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude</li> 
                    <li>Can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) for Numbers</li>
                    <li>Created by appending N to the end of an integer or by calling the BigInt() function.</li>
                    <li>Can use most operators with BigInts</li>
                  </ul>

          <li>JS SYNTAX</li>
          <ul>
            <li>VAR ____ declares a variable</li>
            <li>STRINGS need ""</li>
            <li>CONSOLE.LOG outputs a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
            <li>NaN ("Not a Number") is a special kind of number value that's typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>It is also the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>ACCESSOR pairs a key with one of two ACCESSOR functions (get and set) to retrieve or store a value.</li>
            <li>GET a function called with an empty argument list to retrieve the property value whenever a get access to the value is performed</li>
            <li>SET a function called with an argument that contains the assigned value. Executed whenever a specified property is attempted to be changed.</li>
            <li>ENUMERABLE a boolean value indicating if the property can be enumerated by a for...in loop. </li>
            <li>CONFIGURABLE a boolean value indicating if the property can be deleted, can be changed to a data property, and can have its attributes changed.</li>
            <li>OBJECTS are ad-hoc key-value pairs, so they are often used as MAPS.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Can be ergonomics, security, and performance issues</li>
              </ul>
            <li>MAP is preferred for storing arbitrary data </li>
            <li>IF / ELSE IF / ELSE code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Preferred because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file making design changes easier</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Coding principle encouraging developers to reuse or share pieces of code to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
              <li>DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Separation of Concerns is a widely used term in web development</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Refers to separating code into different files based on use</li>
              <li>It is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility</li>
            </ul> 
          <li>REAL INTERACTIVITY on a website requires event handlers.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response.</li>
            </ul> 
          <li>CONTROL FLOW or the order in which a computer executes code</li>
          <li>CONDITIONALS are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. </li>
